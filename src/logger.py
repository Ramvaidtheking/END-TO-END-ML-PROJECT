#This file contains info for log file
'''
A log file is a text file where a program records information about its operations while itâ€™s running. It's mainly used for:

 Tracking what the program is doing

 Debugging errors or issues

 Monitoring performance or activity

 Recording important events for security or audits

 Imagine your program is writing a diary entry every time something important happens. For example:

"Started running at 3:00 PM"

"User clicked the button"

"Error: Could not connect to database"

"Completed task successfully"

'''This creates a log file name using the current date and time.

    Example output: "04_16_2025_14_32_10.log"'''
